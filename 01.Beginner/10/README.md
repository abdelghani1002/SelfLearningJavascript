### Exercise: Capitalize the first letter of each word in a sentence

#### Task:
Write a JavaScript function named `capitalizeFirstLetter` that takes a sentence as input and returns a new sentence where the first letter of each word is capitalized.

#### Expected Result:
For example, if the input sentence is "hello world", the expected result should be:
```
Original sentence: hello world
Capitalized sentence: Hello World
```
If the input sentence is "javascript is awesome", the expected result should be:
```
Original sentence: javascript is awesome
Capitalized sentence: Javascript Is Awesome
```

#### Hints:
1. Use the `split()` method to split the sentence into an array of words.
2. Iterate through the array and capitalize the first letter of each word.
3. Use the `charAt()` and `toUpperCase()` methods to capitalize the first letter.
4. Use `console.log()` to display the result.

#### Additional Tasks (Optional):
- Add validation to ensure that the input value is a string.
- Allow the user to input the sentence using prompts.
- Test the function with different input sentences to verify its correctness.

### Exercise: Reverse a string

#### Task:
Write a JavaScript function named `reverseString` that takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of the string.

#### Expected Result:
For example, if the input string is "hello", the expected result should be:
```
The reversed string of "hello" is "olleh".
```
If the input string is "javascript", the expected result should be:
```
The reversed string of "javascript" is "tpircsavaj".
```

#### Hints:
1. Use the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods to reverse the string.
2. Remember that strings are immutable, so you need to convert the string to an array of characters first.
3. Use `console.log()` to display the result.

#### Additional Tasks (Optional):
- Add validation to ensure that the input value is a string.
- Allow the user to input the string using a prompt.
- Test the function with different input values to verify its correctness.

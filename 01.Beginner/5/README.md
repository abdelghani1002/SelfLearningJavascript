### Exercise: Find the largest element in an array

#### Task:
Write a JavaScript function named `findLargestElement` that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the largest element in the array.

#### Expected Result:
For example, if the input array is `[3, 7, 2, 9, 4]`, the expected result should be:
```
The largest element in the array [3, 7, 2, 9, 4] is 9.
```
If the input array is `[15, 27, 10, 35, 20, 45]`, the expected result should be:
```
The largest element in the array [15, 27, 10, 35, 20, 45] is 45.
```

#### Hints:
1. Iterate through the array and keep track of the largest element found so far.
2. Initialize a variable to store the largest element and update it as you iterate through the array.
3. Use `console.log()` to display the result.

#### Additional Tasks (Optional):
- Add validation to ensure that the input value is an array of numbers.
- Allow the user to input the array using prompts.
- Test the function with different input arrays to verify its correctness.

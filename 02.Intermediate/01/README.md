### Exercise: Find the factorial of a number

#### Task:
Write a JavaScript function named `calculateFactorial` that takes a number as input and returns its factorial.

#### Expected Result:
For example, if the input number is 5, the expected result should be:
```
The factorial of 5 is 120.
```
If the input number is 0, the expected result should be:
```
The factorial of 0 is 1.
```

#### Hints:
1. Factorial of a non-negative integer n (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
2. Use recursion to calculate the factorial.
3. Implement a base case for terminating the recursion when the input number is 0 or 1.
4. Use `console.log()` to display the result.

#### Additional Tasks (Optional):
- Add validation to ensure that the input value is a non-negative integer.
- Allow the user to input the number using prompts.
- Test the function with different input numbers to verify its correctness.

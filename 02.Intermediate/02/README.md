### Exercise: Check for a prime number

#### Task:
Write a JavaScript function named `isPrime` that takes a number as input and returns `true` if it's a prime number, and `false` otherwise.

#### Expected Result:
For example, if the input number is 7, the expected result should be:
```
7 is a prime number: true
```
If the input number is 10, the expected result should be:
```
10 is a prime number: false
```

#### Hints:
1. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
2. Use a loop to iterate from 2 to the square root of the input number.
3. Check if the input number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
4. Use `console.log()` to display the result.

#### Additional Tasks (Optional):
- Add validation to ensure that the input value is a positive integer.
- Allow the user to input the number using prompts.
- Test the function with different input numbers to verify its correctness.

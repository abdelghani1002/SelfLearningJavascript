### Exercise: Sort an array of integers in ascending order

#### Task:
Write a JavaScript function named `sortAscending` that takes an array of integers as input and returns a new array with the integers sorted in ascending order.

#### Expected Result:
For example, if the input array is `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]`, the expected result should be:
```
Sorted array in ascending order: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]
```
If the input array is `[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, the expected result should be:
```
Sorted array in ascending order: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

#### Hints:
1. Use the `sort()` method to sort the array in ascending order.
2. Optionally, you can implement your sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort) for a deeper exercise.
3. Use `console.log()` to display the result.

#### Additional Tasks (Optional):
- Add validation to ensure that the input value is an array of integers.
- Allow the user to input the array using prompts.
- Test the function with different input arrays to verify its correctness.

### Exercise: Implement a basic calculator

#### Task:
Write a JavaScript function named `basicCalculator` that takes two numbers and an operator as input and returns the result of the arithmetic operation.

#### Expected Result:
For example, if the input is `2`, `3`, and `+`, the expected result should be:
```
Result of 2 + 3 is 5.
```
If the input is `5`, `2`, and `-`, the expected result should be:
```
Result of 5 - 2 is 3.
```
If the input is `4`, `2`, and `*`, the expected result should be:
```
Result of 4 * 2 is 8.
```
If the input is `6`, `2`, and `/`, the expected result should be:
```
Result of 6 / 2 is 3.
```

#### Hints:
1. Use a switch statement or if-else conditions to perform different operations based on the operator.
2. Handle division by zero and invalid operators.
3. Use `console.log()` to display the result.

#### Additional Tasks (Optional):
- Allow the user to input the numbers and operator using prompts.
- Add validation to ensure that the input values are valid numbers and operator.
- Test the function with different input combinations to verify its correctness.

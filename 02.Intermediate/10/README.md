### Exercise: Find the longest word in a sentence

#### Task:
Write a JavaScript function named `findLongestWord` that takes a sentence as input and returns the longest word in the sentence.

#### Expected Result:
For example, if the input sentence is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", the expected result should be:
```
The longest word in the sentence is: jumps
```
If the input sentence is "Hello world!", the expected result should be:
```
The longest word in the sentence is: Hello
```

#### Hints:
1. Split the sentence into words using a space as a delimiter.
2. Iterate through the words and keep track of the length of each word.
3. Find the word with the maximum length.
4. Use `console.log()` to display the result.

#### Additional Tasks (Optional):
- Add validation to ensure that the input value is a string.
- Allow the user to input the sentence using prompts.
- Test the function with different input sentences to verify its correctness.

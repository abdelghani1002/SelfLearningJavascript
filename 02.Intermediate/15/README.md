### Exercise: Check if a string is an anagram

#### Task:
Write a JavaScript function named `isAnagram` that takes two strings as input and returns `true` if one string is an anagram of the other, and `false` otherwise.

#### Expected Result:
For example, if the input strings are "listen" and "silent", the expected result should be:
```
"listen" is an anagram of "silent": true
```
If the input strings are "hello" and "world", the expected result should be:
```
"hello" is an anagram of "world": false
```

#### Hints:
1. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase.
2. Count the occurrence of each character in both strings.
3. Compare the character counts to determine if they are anagrams.
4. Use `console.log()` to display the result.

#### Additional Tasks (Optional):
- Add validation to ensure that the input values are strings.
- Allow the user to input the strings using prompts.
- Test the function with different input strings to verify its correctness.

### Exercise: Shuffle an array randomly

#### Task:
Write a JavaScript function named `shuffleArray` that takes an array as input and shuffles its elements randomly.

#### Expected Result:
For example, if the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the expected result should be an array with the same elements but in a random order, such as:
```
Shuffled array: [4, 2, 5, 1, 3]
```

#### Hints:
1. Implement an algorithm to randomly shuffle the elements of the array.
2. You can use techniques like Fisher-Yates shuffle or Durstenfeld shuffle.
3. Each element in the input array should have an equal chance of being in any position in the shuffled array.
4. Use `console.log()` to display the result.

#### Additional Tasks (Optional):
- Add validation to ensure that the input value is an array.
- Allow the user to input the array using prompts.
- Test the function with different input arrays to verify its correctness.

### Exercise: Find the second largest element in an array

#### Task:
Write a JavaScript function named `findSecondLargest` that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the second largest element in the array.

#### Expected Result:
For example, if the input array is `[3, 1, 4, 2, 5]`, the expected result should be:
```
The second largest element is: 4
```
If the input array is `[10, 5, 10, 8, 7]`, the expected result should be:
```
The second largest element is: 8
```

#### Hints:
1. Find the maximum element in the array.
2. Remove the maximum element from the array.
3. Find the maximum element again in the modified array to get the second largest element.
4. Use `console.log()` to display the result.

#### Additional Tasks (Optional):
- Add validation to ensure that the input value is an array of numbers.
- Allow the user to input the array using prompts.
- Test the function with different input arrays to verify its correctness.
